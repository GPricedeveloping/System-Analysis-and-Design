# System-Analysis-and-Design

For the DriverPass project, we worked with a driving school to create a digital system for managing driver training appointments. Our goal was to make scheduling appointments easy for both instructors and students. I did a great job of making sure our documents were clear and organized, which helped everyone understand what we were doing. However, I think I could improve the design of the system to make it even easier for people to use. In the future, I'll focus more on getting feedback from users to make sure our system works well for everyone. When designing software, I like to start by talking to people and understanding what they need. I use simple techniques like drawing pictures and writing stories to plan out how the software will work. Then, I keep improving it based on what people tell me. I'll keep doing this in the future, always trying to make better and easier-to-use software for everyone.
